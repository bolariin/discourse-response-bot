# Discourse Response Bot
This is a [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) plugin. It works as a bot automatically replying newly created topics within a Discourse forum with a default wiki post. This allows users to collaborate and construct a single answer for topics created.

```yml

        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - mkdir -p plugins

```
rebuild your container:
